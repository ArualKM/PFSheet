# PathForge — working notes for Claude

PathForge is a Pathfinder 1e character sheet + campaign platform. Full spec:
`docs/PathForge Full-Stack Build Instructions.docx` (33 sections, 11 milestones).
Design reference: `docs/mockups/`.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # dev server (Turbopack) on :3000
pnpm build        # production build
pnpm test         # Vitest unit tests (schema + rules engine)
pnpm typecheck    # tsc across app + all packages
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm test:e2e     # Playwright
```

Always run `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm typecheck` before considering work done.

## Layout

- `app/` — App Router. Route groups: `(marketing)` public, `(auth)` login/signup, `(app)` is the
  authenticated shell (gated by `requireUser()` in its layout + `proxy.ts`).
- `packages/pathforge-schema` — canonical character schema (Zod). **Source of truth** for the sheet
  shape. `createDefaultCharacter()` produces a valid sheet; `parseCharacter()` validates.
- `packages/pathforge-rules-pf1e` — the formula engine + `computeCharacter()`. All game math lives
  here, never in components.
- `lib/supabase/` — `client.ts` (browser), `server.ts` (RLS, per-request), `admin.ts` (secret key,
  bypasses RLS — trusted server only), `middleware.ts` (session refresh helper used by `proxy.ts`).
- `supabase/migrations/` — `0001` schema, `0002` RLS, `0003` cleanup/hardening.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **No `eval` for formulas, ever.** Use `@pathforge/rules-pf1e`'s parser/evaluator.
- **GMs cannot edit a player's canonical sheet** unless they're an `editor`/`co_owner`
  collaborator. RLS enforces this; don't add app-level bypasses.
- **Spell Compendium** (`public.spell_compendium`, ~3,034 rows) is preserved from the old DB.
  Never drop/alter it. It powers `/spells` and spellcasting.
- Next 16 uses **`proxy.ts`**, not `middleware.ts` (renamed convention).
- Supabase typed client needs `@supabase/ssr` ≥ 0.12 with `supabase-js` 2.108 — older `ssr` 0.5.x
  collapses query result types to `never`. `lib/supabase/types.ts` is generated; regenerate after
  migrations (Supabase MCP `generate_typescript_types`).
- Theme classes on `<html>`: `obsidian` (default dark), `parchment` (light), `high_contrast`.
  Tokens are `--pf-*` in `app/globals.css`, mapped to Tailwind colors via `@theme inline`.
- Supabase project ref: `ldhpdstmgvcsiiupckqx` (org `sjyhdefqdeuifepkxotc`, "PFSheet"). The
  original project `zsopoqfzdjmfmckadkse` ("PathForge") was retired — see the Status note. Use
  the Supabase MCP for DB work; run `get_advisors` after DDL.
- Migrations: `0001` schema, `0002` security/RLS, `0003` cleanup/hardening, `0004` RLS hardening,
  `0005` restore trigger grants, `0006` spell_compendium (table; data seeded separately), `0007`
  fix `characters` SELECT-on-RETURNING.

## Status

Milestone 0 (foundation) complete: scaffold, design system, app shell, auth, dashboard,
characters list + create + computed overview, spell browser, DB schema + RLS, schema & formula
packages with tests.

Milestone 4 (overview + share) complete: privacy view-model (`lib/character/view-model.ts`,
§15 `buildCharacterViewModel`), full mockup-faithful `CharacterDashboard`, public share view at
`/c/[publicSlug]` (admin-client + visibility gate, returns only the filtered model), share
controls + publish/visibility action. Privacy + render tests cover "public never leaks private".

Milestone 5 (edit workspace) — complete: `useCharacterEditor` (client draft + live recompute +
debounced autosave + undo + unsaved-changes guard), `CharacterEditor` with Identity/Abilities/
Health/Saves/AC/Skills/Feats/Profile tabs, a live-values preview, the Simple/Advanced toggle, and
a "Show Math" formula inspector (formula + resolved terms per value). `saveCharacterSheetAction`
validates + recomputes + persists (RLS-gated). Engine now resolves per-stat modifiers
(AC components, save misc, init) entered directly on the sheet, and exposes `ComputedValue.terms`
for the inspector. AC editor writes typed component bonuses into
`defenses.armorClass.conditionalModifiers`.

Milestone 6 (Buff Center) — complete: `BuffCenter` "Buffs" tab (toggle cards with live affected-value
deltas, stacking-conflict warnings, duration + round countdown, bulk actions, library/custom/
duplicate/save-as-template); a 20-entry PF1e buff library (`buff-templates.ts`); engine ingests
ability-boost buffs into `computeAbilities` (with enhancement/inherent stacking), computes effective
speed (`summary.speed`), and exposes `detectStackingConflicts` / `activeBuffDelta` / `previewBuffEffects`.

Edit workspace now covers all of §6 — tabs: Identity, Abilities, Health, Saves, AC, Combat, Skills,
Feats, Buffs, Spells, Inventory, Profile (`combat-editor.tsx`, `spellcasting-editor.tsx`,
`inventory-editor.tsx`, plus deepened Identity/Abilities/Health/Profile in `character-editor.tsx`).
`NumberField` coerces ints, associates labels (useId/htmlFor), and keeps a clearable local draft.
Both M6 and the detailed editors shipped after adversarial Workflow reviews (findings verified + fixed).

Post-M6 additions (each shipped after an adversarial Workflow review):
- **Spell-compendium picker** (`spell-picker.tsx` + `search_spell_compendium` RPC, migrations `0008`/
  `0009`): class/level-aware, ranked (name→school→descriptor→description), debounced, wildcard-safe.
- **Formula-valued buff effects**: an effect's value may be a `@{...}` formula resolved against a base
  resolver (e.g. Divine Favor / Power Attack scale off level/BAB); the custom-buff form has a ƒx toggle.
- **§6 navigation reorg**: a left "Sheet Sections" sidebar (Core/Defenses/Attacks/Abilities/Skills/
  Spells/Equipment/Buffs/Story/Settings) with ARIA tab roles + roving-tabindex keyboard nav, and a
  Settings **Optional rules & 3pp** framework (`optional-rules.ts` — Mythic + ~17 modules toggled into
  `rules.variants` / `rules.modules`; `isRuleEnabled` / `isModuleKeyEnabled` let sections reveal a
  module's fields as it ships). See [[pathforge-modularity-roadmap]].

Deferred sheet depth: per-module field reveals for the optional-rules framework (Mythic tier/path,
hero points, psionics, spheres, path of war, … — toggles persist; fields come per module), feat/feature
+ equipped-item automation editing, level-plan rows, multiple Craft/Perform/Profession, Senses/
Languages/Resources tabs, spell resistance, ability-field a11y name context, **mobile overhaul** of the
new sidebar/3-column layout (ties into M10), and preserving in-progress form state across tab switches.

Next per spec: GM audit + campaign workflow (M7), imports (M8), exports + API (M9), PWA/offline (M10),
polish/QA (M11).

### Infra note — character-create RLS fix + project migration (2026-06-25)

Symptom: every character create failed with "new row violates row-level security policy for
table characters" (live app + direct PostgREST). Root cause was **not** auth/JWT: the
`characters_select` policy used only `can_view_character(id, auth.uid())`, a SECURITY DEFINER
function that re-queries `characters` by id. PostgREST runs `INSERT ... RETURNING` for the app's
`.insert().select()`, and the just-inserted row isn't visible to that function's snapshot, so the
owner couldn't read back their own new row → reported as an RLS insert violation. A plain insert
(`return=minimal`) always succeeded; only the RETURNING path failed. Fix = migration `0007`: add a
direct `owner_id = auth.uid()` predicate (always visible in RETURNING) before the function call.

The original Supabase project's signing keys had been churned while mis-diagnosing this as a JWT
issue, so work moved to a fresh project (`ldhpdstmgvcsiiupckqx`). All 7 migrations were applied,
`spell_compendium` (3,034 rows) copied over, and the full create→edit→share + spell-browser flow
verified green. The old project can be deleted once the new one is confirmed in production.
