 * Level-up wizard — the per-character progress flag (`docs/LEVELUP_WIZARD/MASTER_PLAN.md`, "The
 * flag design"). Same shape family as `wizard.ts`'s create-wizard flag, but deliberately a
 * SEPARATE, independently-versioned module — NOT a generalization of the two into one polymorphic
 * bag. The two flags' shapes already diverge on day one (level-up needs `fromLevel`/`targetLevel`/
 * `startingMaxHp`, which the create wizard never needed), and sharing one `order`/`*_ORDER_VERSION`
 * would let a future create-wizard reorder accidentally invalidate an in-flight level-up checkpoint,
 * or vice versa — two small, independent modules is lower-risk than one generic one two features
 * immediately need to diverge from.
 *
 * Lives entirely inside the existing free-form `metadata.custom` bag (`z.record(z.string(),
 * z.unknown())` — see `./meta.ts`), so this module is purely an OPTIONAL parse/write helper: zero
 * schema changes to the canonical character shape, zero DB migration. A character that never
 * started a level-up session simply never has this key.

 * Unlike `writeWizardMeta` (which defaults a fresh `active: true`, because the create wizard's only

 * The level-up flag has more than one plausible caller shape long-term (a step writing its own
 * progress vs. the entry action starting a session), so silently activating the shell from an
 * unrelated first-touch patch would be a real footgun — `startLevelUpAction` (the only intended way
 * to BEGIN a session) always passes `active: true` explicitly. Likewise `fromLevel`/`targetLevel`
 * have no sane real default — there is no "safe" level — so an omitted-on-first-write value falls
 * back to the neutral `0`, a visibly-wrong placeholder a caller notices immediately, rather than
 * throwing and breaking the same merge-patch convention every other caller relies on.

 * already-computed, in-canonical-order list of visible keys rather than an editor session, so only
 * the shell (which owns the `ed`-dependent visibility predicates) ever has to evaluate them.
 *
 * Contract:
 * 1. A checkpoint NOT stamped with the current `LEVEL_UP_ORDER_VERSION` resumes at the first visible
 *    step — conservative by construction. Nothing older than v1 exists yet (this is the flag's first
 *    version), but the guard exists from day one, mirroring `resumeStepFor`'s reasoning: a future
 *    reorder must not silently strand an in-flight session.
 * 2. Otherwise, find `meta.step`'s position in `LEVEL_UP_STEP_KEYS` and walk FORWARD to the first key
 *    at-or-after that position that's in `visibleKeys` — a step that's no longer visible (e.g. the
 *    player removed the class that made ASI eligible) is skipped rather than resuming on an
 *    empty/nonsensical panel; the step itself resumes literally when it's still visible.
 * 3. If nothing at-or-after the stored position is visible, resume at the LAST visible key — the
 *    session has effectively finished its guided portion, so land on Review.
 * 4. If `visibleKeys` is empty — shouldn't happen, `class` and `review` are always visible — fall
 *    back to `"class"` rather than throwing.
